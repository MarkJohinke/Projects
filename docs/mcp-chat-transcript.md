# MCP Chat Transcript

Note: This file preserves the conversation context that led to the current MCP server implementation, deployment approach on DS423+, testing steps, and next actions. It complements the structured docs in this folder.

Transcript (condensed chronology)

- User: Let’s get DS43+ and DS418play on Tailscale and connected via MCP so ChatGPT can interact with the NAS.
- Assistant: Proposed plan; asked clarifying questions (admin access, MCP host, access modes).
- User: Tailscale already set up (with Funnel); asked about MCP host options and possibilities.
- Assistant: Recommended MCP host options (single Linux VM/DS423+ via Docker), access modes (SSH/SFTP/HTTP), Tailnet Peering. Offered to scaffold.
- User: Asked for Node and Python; which host best (Yoga, DS423+, DS418play); agreed to Tailnet Peering.
- Assistant: Recommended Node primary + Python helpers, host preferably VM or DS423+ via Docker; offered to scaffold.
- User: Proceed.
- Assistant: Implemented Node + Python scaffold with SSH tools; Dockerfile and docker-compose with Tailscale sidecar; env config; README with ACL example.
- User: Wire into MCP; SSH ports 22; allow write.
- Assistant: Added HTTP debug API and MCP WebSocket server with tools: nas.exec, nas.read, nas.write, nas.listDir, nas.move, nas.delete, nas.checkRaid.
- User: “everything”.
- Assistant: Proposed roadmap (file streaming, DSM APIs, admin helpers, audit, safety). Asked about delete behavior (recursive opt-in) and denylists.
- User: Yes.
- Assistant: Implemented SFTP-like tools (list/move/delete), updated docs.
- User: Test first.
- Assistant: Provided exact test steps; added automated test script (npm test) covering HTTP and WS basics.
- User: How to test in simple steps and why.
- Assistant: Provided simplified test guide with explanations.
- User: Purpose of MCP server?
- Assistant: Explained goals: unify access, expose safe tools, guardrails, multi-protocol bridge, keep secrets local, reliability.
- User: Should containers appear in DSM UI?
- Assistant: Yes on DS423+ if run there; otherwise no.
- User: Only sees nginx-1.
- Assistant: Diagnosed likely causes; provided steps to run on DS423+ via Compose or DSM UI.
- User: Can do both?
- Assistant: Delivered both guides (Compose and DSM UI) with testing; troubleshooting; created docs.
- User: Uses Hyper Backup (not rsync).
- Assistant: Adapted deployment flow to Hyper Backup; suggested post-backup redeploy; added scripts/redeploy.sh.
- User: Automate via DSM Task Scheduler.
- Assistant: Provided Task Scheduler setup including optional Hyper Backup post-backup hook.
- User: Asked if the whole chat is saved and requested a single-file archive.
- Assistant: Added this transcript file alongside other docs.

What’s implemented now
- Dockerized MCP server on Node (with Python helpers) exposing tools over HTTP :8765 and MCP WebSocket :8766.
- SSH-based operations to both NAS (port 22), including exec, read, write, list, move, delete, and RAID check.
- Tailscale sidecar networking with recommended Tailnet Peering.
- Test runner (`npm test`) and concise docs for deploy, testing, and troubleshooting.

What’s planned
- DSM HTTP tools (auth + File Station): login/logout, list/mkdir/move/delete.
- Admin helpers: SMART, storage summary, docker list, log tail.
- Optional: write audit log, exec allowlist, denylist safeguards, chunked upload/download.

Operational notes
- Place SSH private key in `secrets/id_ed25519` on DS423+; public key on both NAS service user `svc_mcp`.
- Use Tailnet Peering so one MCP instance reaches both tailnets.
- Keep Tailscale ACLs tight (only MCP host can reach NAS SSH/DSM ports).
